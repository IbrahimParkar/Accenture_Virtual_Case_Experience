We are conducting a thorough audit of their big data practice, analyzing the top 5 content categories for popularity, and providing valuable insights. Throughout the 3-month engagement, we are collaborating closely with the Social Buzz team to ensure impactful data analysis and delivering meaningful results.

Let's take a look at the challenges SocialBuzz is facing in their data analysis process. Firstly, they encounter complexity in analyzing diverse data types, including text, images, videos, and GIFs. They also need assistance in identifying the top 5 content categories with the highest aggregate popularity. Furthermore, SocialBuzz requires support in data extraction and integration from various sources. They seek help in visually presenting analysis results and deriving meaningful insights. Additionally, they need guidance in establishing robust data governance practices to ensure data quality, accuracy, and compliance.

Next I would like to introduce you to the analyst team working on the SocialBuzz project. Leading the team is Andrew Flemming, our Chief Technology Architect. Assisting him is Marcus Rompton, a seasoned Senior Principal. And lastly, we have myself Ibrahim Parkar, a skilled Data Analyst who has been instrumental in uncovering valuable insights from SocialBuzz's data.

I undertook a structured process to uncover insights from SocialBuzz's data. This process involved understanding the data sources, cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, creating data models, performing thorough analysis, and extracting valuable insights. 

After analyzing the data, it is evident that the top five categories with the highest scores are animals, science, healthy eating, technology, and food.
