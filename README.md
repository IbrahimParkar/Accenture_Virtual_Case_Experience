## Project Tasks

Throughout the virtual experience, I completed practical tasks in the following areas:

1. Project Understanding

The initial phase involved gaining a comprehensive understanding of the project objectives, requirements, and data sources. I conducted thorough research to identify the key questions to be addressed through data analysis.

2. Data Cleaning & Modeling

In this phase, I performed essential data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and resolving inconsistencies. Additionally, I applied appropriate data modeling techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, such as feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, or creating statistical models.

3. Data Visualization & Storytelling

Data visualization played a crucial role in presenting the analyzed data in a visually appealing and informative manner. I utilized data visualization tools and techniques to create insightful charts, graphs, and interactive visual representations. These visualizations were designed to effectively communicate trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

Furthermore, I leveraged storytelling techniques to weave together the data visualizations and provide a coherent narrative. A storytelling approach was adopted to present the data insights in a compelling and engaging manner, enabling stakeholders to understand the significance and implications of the findings.

4. Present to the Client

In the final phase, I prepared and delivered a comprehensive presentation to the client. The presentation showcased the data analysis process, highlighted key findings, and provided actionable recommendations based on the insights gained from the data. This involved effectively communicating the project objectives, the methodology used, the visualized results, and the potential business impact of the analysis.
